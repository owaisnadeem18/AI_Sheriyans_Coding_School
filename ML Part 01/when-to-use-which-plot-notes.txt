When to use which plot during our EDA
process: 

1. Correlation
Goal: See relationships between numeric variables.

Plot:

Heatmap → sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')

Use when you have many numeric columns and want a quick overview.

2. Distribution of a single numeric variable
Goal: Understand shape (normal, skewed, etc.).

Plot:

Histogram → sns.histplot(df['col'], kde=True)

KDE Plot → sns.kdeplot(df['col']) (smooth density curve)

Use for continuous variables like age, salary.

3. Relationship between two numeric variables
Goal: See correlation visually.

Plot:

Scatter Plot → sns.scatterplot(x='col1', y='col2', data=df)

Use for features like height vs weight.

4. Relationship between categorical and numeric variables
Goal: Compare distributions across categories.

Plot:

Boxplot → sns.boxplot(x='category', y='numeric', data=df)

Violin Plot → sns.violinplot(...) (shows distribution + density)

Barplot → sns.barplot(...) (mean values)

5. Relationship between two categorical variables
Goal: See frequency combinations.

Plot:

Countplot → sns.countplot(x='cat1', hue='cat2', data=df)

Use for things like gender vs smoker.

6. Outlier Detection
Goal: Identify unusual values.

Plot:

Boxplot → best for spotting outliers.

Swarmplot → shows individual points + boxplot.

7. Time Series
Goal: See trends over time.

Plot:

Line Plot → sns.lineplot(x='date', y='value', data=df)
